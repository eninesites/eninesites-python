"""Enforce arch-python/PYTHON.md §3: the `__main__.py` + `commands()` CLI contract.

Scope is deliberately narrow: this script checks commands only.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, stated here because the absence is easy to mistake for coverage:
it grades the command CONTRACT, never which slot a name occupies. `CLI.md` §"Noun or verb"
holds that rule -- a verb leaf takes no subparser, needing a subparser forces a noun leaf.
`lexicon.py check` (the nounspace step of `make arch`) asserts the half of it that is
decidable without English: a node must be a noun the lexicon declares, and a subcommand
must be one of that noun's declared verbs. What is still unasserted is whether the WORD
in a noun slot reads as a noun, which is the node that defines it, not an AST.

It does not reimplement §1 (Module Structure) or §2 (Imports) — those are owned by
`import-linter` (acyclicity, direction) and `check_upward_imports.py` (upward
imports from business modules). Run those alongside this one.

At every node in the CLI tree rooted at `<pkg>` the walker confirms:

1. The package exposes `commands() -> list[tuple[str, str]]` with direct-child
   names (no dots).
2. Symbol presence matches one of the three patterns:
     - `commands()` non-empty + no `main()`    → Pattern 1 (pure discovery)
     - `commands()` non-empty +  `main()`      → Pattern 2 (discovery + own CLI)
     - `commands()` empty     +  `main()`      → Pattern 3 (leaf)
   Patterns 1 and 2 must also expose `_print_commands()` — every intermediate
   owns its own print layer, no inheritance.
3. Subprocess behaviour matches the pattern:
     - `python -m <pkg>` with no args exits 0 at every node that describes when bare
       (every node but a verb leaf, which runs its action), prints its listing or,
       for a node with verbs, its help (`usage:`), and writes nothing. Every probe
       runs in an empty cwd, HOME and TMPDIR, so a node that acts acts there.
     - For non-empty `commands()`, the no-args output lists exactly one
       `python -m <pkg>.<name>   <desc>` line per entry and stdout is non-empty.
     - `python -m <pkg> --help` exits 0 at every node.
4. Each listed child `<pkg>.<name>` is a real, runnable entry point — either a
   sub-package with its own `__main__.py` (recurse into it) or a `.py` module
   with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard. BOTH shapes are read the same
   way: the module shape gets `parser()` introspection, `subcommands()`, and
   the no-silent-omission scan exactly as the package shape does.
5. Registration symmetry: the filesystem under `pkg` is scanned for any
   direct-child sub-package with a `__main__.py`, or any `.py` module with an
   `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, that is NOT in `commands()`. These are
   orphan CLIs — hidden capabilities that no parent names. §3 is explicit:
   registration is manual, not dynamic, so an unregistered deeper `__main__.py`
   is a violation. Orphan sub-packages are descended into so their own subtrees
   are audited too.

# Importable API

    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, ".racecar/scripts")   # racecar's own tree calls it "scripts"
    from check_cli_commands import audit_cli_tree
    tree = audit_cli_tree("fubar")        # enriched Node, JSON-serialisable

Import it by putting that directory on the path and using the BARE name, never
`from .racecar/scripts.check_cli_commands import …`. It holds no `__init__.py`, so
the dotted form gives mypy a second module name for one file and it aborts the
whole run with "Source file found twice under different module names" before
checking anything — a caller who follows the documented form breaks their own
typecheck gate. lexicon.py imports this module the same way, for the same
reason.

Every node in the returned tree carries both the audit affordances AND
the agent-facing resolutions, side by side:

        }, ...
      ] | null,
    }

This is the canonical CLI surface. It is the SINGLE source of enrichment
— `command` strings, short `role` labels, and parent-supplied
`description` fields are computed here so downstream consumers don't
reimplement them. Downstream is free to SUMMARIZE (drop fields, suppress
empties) for its own needs; downstream does NOT enrich.

# CLI

    python scripts/check_cli_commands.py [<root> ...]
    python scripts/check_cli_commands.py --json <root>

A `<root>` is a dotted package name (`acme`) or a filesystem path to the
package directory (`src/acme`). A path to a namespace directory with no
`__init__.py` — `src`, or `.` — is descended one level to its sole child
package (ambiguity errors). With no `<root>` at all, the default is `src`
when a src/ layout is present, else the current directory. A path root is
put on `sys.path`, so the audit imports it; the `python -m <pkg>` probes need
the package importable by the Python that runs them, and raise if it is not.

Default output is the walked tree plus a violations summary. With
`--json`, emits the enriched tree (single dict for one root, list of
dicts for multiple) to stdout.

Exits 0 if clean, 1 if any violation is found.

# ---------- subprocess probes (parallelised) ----------------------------- #
#
# The audit's wall-clock cost is dominated by cold `python -m <pkg> ...`
# spawns: every node needs `--help`, every node with non-empty `commands()`
# needs a no-args listing probe, and every entry in `subcommands()` needs a
# `<sub> --help` probe. Serially that's O(N) cold interpreter starts.
#
# To overlap them we split the audit into two passes:
#
#   1. Structural walk (`_audit_package`) — imports, AST scans, classify,
#      orphan scan, child recursion. No `_run` calls. Wherever a
#      subprocess-derived violation would land, the walk drops a `_Probe`
#      sentinel into the node's `violations` list and registers the same
#      sentinel for the fan-out step.
#   2. Fan-out + resolve (`audit_cli_tree`) — every probe is submitted to a
#      shared `ThreadPoolExecutor` at once; results come back in any order;
#      a final tree walk replaces each `_Probe` with the actual violation
#      strings it produced.
#
# Doing the swap in-place inside `violations` keeps a fixed per-node ordering
# (subcommand-help cluster → parser-introspect violations → AST-scan
# violations → `--help` violation → no-args cluster → orphan violations),
# which exact-equality tests against the audit tree rely on.

    every node carries both the audit affordances (`pkg`, `kind`,
    `pattern`, `commands`, `subcommands`, `orphan`, `violations`,
    `children`) AND the resolved fields downstream consumers actually
    want to read:

      - `command`: the literal `python -m <pkg>` invocation.
      - `role`:    short pattern label — `pure-discovery`,
                   `discovery+cli`, or `leaf`.
      - `description`: the parent's `commands()` blurb for this child,
                       or `None` on the top-level root (no parent).
      - `subcommands` (when declared via `subcommands()`): rewritten from
                   raw `[name, desc]` tuples into enriched dicts with
                   `name`, `command` (`python -m <pkg> <name>`), and
                   `description`. Consumers reading the agent-facing
                   subparsers don't have to construct the invocation.

    This is the SINGLE place enrichment happens, by design. Downstream
    consumers (SessionStart hook, doc generators, CI) take the
    enriched tree and summarize for their use case; they do not
    re-derive these fields themselves.
