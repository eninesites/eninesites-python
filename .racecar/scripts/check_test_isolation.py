"""Report a test that reaches the user's real state instead of a scratch copy of it.

A test that writes the machine's real settings store, home directory or keychain changes
the running application on the machine that runs the suite. A3 (`check_red.py`) cannot see
it: such a test fails without its fix and passes with it, like any good test. What gives it
away is what the test file touches, so this reads test files for the handles that reach
real state and reports each at `file:line`.

The handles are data, one row per language, added when an incident gives evidence and not
ahead of it. The Swift row is from one: a test wrote `UserDefaults.standard` and broke the
settings of the app its user was running.

A use that is meant is marked where it is, with `racecar: real-state <reason>` in a comment
on that line or the line above, and is then not reported. The reason is the point: the
mark is read mechanically, and a mark with no reason is reported as one.

Exit codes:
  - 0: nothing found; or findings, reported as warnings, when `RACECAR_STRICT` is not set.
  - 1: findings, under `RACECAR_STRICT=true`, where they are errors.

Usage:
    python3 <path-to>/check_test_isolation.py [--root <path>] [--tests GLOB ...]

Complexity: O(L) in lines of test files.
