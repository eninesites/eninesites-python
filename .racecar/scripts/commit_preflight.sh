#!/usr/bin/env bash
# racecar commit trial: the functions a /racecar-commit runbook sources to try its commits in a
# throwaway clone of the worktree it runs in, never in the worktree itself.
#
# THE ONE DEFINITION of how racecar tries a commit. There is no other way in: a hand check is
# the runbook's --dry-run (`/racecar-commit --dry-run`), which runs the whole trial and lands
# nothing. Run directly, this file refuses (exit 2) and says so.
#
# WHY A CLONE. In your checkout, pre-commit stashes your unstaged changes for its run, and a
# hook that reads across files judges a commit against files other commits carry. A clone
# holds exactly the commit being tried, so nothing is stashed and every hook judges the commit
# as it will land. And a clone has its own branches and tags, where a second worktree would
# share yours: whatever the trial does stays in it. A live run brings the tried commits back
# (fetch, then a compare-and-swap of the worktree's branch); a dry run deletes the clone.
#
# bash 3.2 compatible (no mapfile, no associative arrays).
