"""Commit a thin, no-prefix launcher for a repo's ``python -m <pkg>…`` CLI.

Every racecar-shaped repo exposes its CLI as ``python -m <pkg>.<noun>[.<subnoun>…]
<verb> [args…]`` (``arch-python/CLI.md``), which requires the caller to be inside the
repo with its venv on ``PATH`` (or spell ``.venv/bin/python -m …`` by hand) every
time. This writes one small, self-locating executable to ``$REPO/bin/<pkg>`` — a
committable file, not a machine-local one::

    acme apt.report build          # was: (cd ~/dev/…/acme && .venv/bin/python -m
                                      #       acme.apt.report build)
    atlas dashboard residency     # was: PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m
                                      #       atlas.dashboard residency

...once ``acme``/``atlas`` is reachable on ``PATH`` — a symlink into the repo
(``--link``, default target ``/usr/local/bin``) being the intended route, since it
keeps working when the repo's own copy changes; a plain ``cp`` elsewhere only runs
correctly if ``<pkg>`` happens to already be importable in whatever interpreter ends
up running it.

**Why ``bin/<pkg>`` and not a bare ``<pkg>`` at the repo root.** `check_docs.py`'s
`_top_level` treats a repo's own root-level entry names as the signal that a cited
path like ``<pkg>/lib/foo.py`` names THIS repo (as opposed to a worked example);
racecar's own docstrings write exactly that shorthand for ``src/<pkg>/lib/foo.py``,
and without a real top-level entry named after the package, that whole citation
style is exempt from validation. A committed file literally
called ``<pkg>`` at the repo root makes ``<pkg>`` such an entry, which flips those
citations into "checked" — against the wrong root, since the real target is under
``src/``. ``bin/`` carries no such name collision and never will.

**What it is not.** Not a new CLI, not a shell alias, not a second surface. The
committed file bakes in exactly one fact — the package's own name — and otherwise
locates its repo from its own path at RUN time (``Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent``,
which follows a symlink back to this repo even when ``PATH`` reaches it through one),
finds that repo's venv the same three-candidate way ``racecar.mk``'s own ``VENV``
auto-detect does, and hands everything else to ``runpy.run_module`` (the documented
equivalent of ``python -m``). No machine-specific path is ever written to disk, which
is what makes the file safe to commit: it works unchanged on every clone, wherever
that clone lives, on whoever's machine — and needs no racecar checkout to run, only
to (re)generate when the CLI tree changes. The package's own ``__main__.py`` +
argparse tree is the one source of truth for every verb and flag; this generates no
structure of its own, exactly as ``lexicon.py`` projects that same tree into
pages rather than inventing one.

**Why re-exec into the venv rather than importing its packages.** A venv's own
``bin/python`` is itself a symlink to a base interpreter, and CPython only honours a
venv's ``pyvenv.cfg`` — and so its site-packages — for a process actually EXECED as
that symlink path, not one that merely adds its site-packages directory to
``sys.path`` by hand (the version-specific ``lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`` name would
have to be hard-coded, and would still miss anything a venv config wires beyond the
path). Re-execing once (guarded so a re-exec cannot loop) is what makes this launcher
correct regardless of which ``python3`` happened to be first on ``PATH``.

Usage::

    python scripts/gen_cli_launcher.py             # print what --write would commit
    python scripts/gen_cli_launcher.py --write      # commit $REPO/bin/<pkg>
    python scripts/gen_cli_launcher.py --check      # non-zero if $REPO/bin/<pkg> is stale/missing
    python scripts/gen_cli_launcher.py --link       # --write, then symlink it onto --link-dir
    python scripts/gen_cli_launcher.py --link-dir DIR   # override the symlink target (default:
                                                         # /usr/local/bin)
    python scripts/gen_cli_launcher.py src/<pkg>    # point at a package (default: auto-discover)

Complexity: O(1) — one package-name lookup, one file written, at most one symlink.

"""GENERATED by racecar `gen_cli_launcher.py` -- DO NOT EDIT.
Regenerate:  {regenerate}

Runs `{pkg}`'s CLI with no `python -m` prefix, no venv to source or activate, and no
racecar on the machine that runs it. Self-locating: `REPO_ROOT` below is the parent
of this file's own real location (it lives at `$REPO/bin/{pkg}`), which is why a
symlink to it (e.g. into /usr/local/bin) keeps working while a plain copy does not --
a copy has no path back to this repo, and only runs correctly where `{pkg}` is
already importable some other way (a `pip install`).

When the repo IS found, this re-execs into its own venv (`.venv` / `venv` / `../venv`,
the same order `racecar.mk`'s `VENV` auto-detect checks) exactly once, because a
venv's interpreter is itself a symlink and Python only honours a venv when invoked AS
that symlink -- adding its site-packages by hand cannot substitute for the swap.

Dispatch reads a DECLARED table, baked in below from the nounspace at generation
time rather than probed at run time. The spelling is unchanged and still mirrors
`python -m`: `{pkg} graph.topology check` IS `python -m {pkg}.graph.topology check`
with the prefix removed. What the table adds is failing by name -- an unknown noun is
told which nouns exist, and a sub-noun written with a space is told to use the dot,
where a probe could only fall through to the root parser. The table comes from
committed declarations, so the bytes are identical on every machine for a given tree.
