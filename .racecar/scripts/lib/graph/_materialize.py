"""Materialize the graph on demand. NOTHING IS CACHED ON DISK.

The tree is the only stored representation: one directory per node, its fields in
that node's README frontmatter, its edges in `pnode`. Everything else — the edge
list, the reverse index, in-degree, coverage — is computed fresh on every read.

A cached projection of a graph is a second home for the graph (P-02): it drifts
silently, and a checker that reads it is validating the cache rather than the tree.

Named `materialize`, not `graph` — the module it lives in is `racecar.graph`, and a
verb sharing its parent's own name (`racecar.graph graph`) reads as a mistake before
anyone runs it. "Materialize" is the word the rule above uses.

Usage:
    python -m racecar.graph materialize            # the tree, with coverage
    python -m racecar.graph materialize --edges    # the edge list
    python -m racecar.graph materialize --orphans  # scripts no node claims

Part of `lib.graph`; `scripts/graph.py` parses the command line and calls `main`. `run`
walks the tree once and returns the one view asked for as a record; `renderer.text` is how
each view reads.

Complexity: O(N) in corpus nodes -- one walk, three views over it.
