"""Derive the perimeter from the delivered checkers, and place what the tree lacks.

The node SET is not a judgement. A declaration exists because a checker reads it, so
the set is a property of the code and belongs to the AST — the hand-written half of a
node is which principle it serves, its class, and its reasoning, none of which the
code knows.

Access chains are walked, not just leaf names: `data["tool"]["racecar"]["lexicon"]
.get("corpora")` yields the site `[tool.racecar.lexicon].corpora`, which is what lets a new
key be filed under the group that already owns its table.

    main(data)              report the gap
    main(data, write=True)  create the placeable nodes; list the rest

Part of `lib.graph`; `scripts/graph.py` parses the command line and calls `main`. `run`
places every derived key the tree lacks and returns the placement as a record;
`renderer.text` is how the record reads.

Complexity: O(C) in delivered checkers -- one AST parse each.
