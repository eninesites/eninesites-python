"""Every graph verb's text view, rendered from the record the verb returns.

The one home of what a person reads. `scripts/graph.py` and `python -m racecar.graph` both
call a verb for its record and hand the record here, so the two routes print the same lines
because only this module prints them.

What it does not hold is the `## Graphs` block itself: that is an artifact `generate` writes
into README.md, not a line anyone is shown, and `lib.graph._render` makes it.
