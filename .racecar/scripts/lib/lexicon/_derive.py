"""Deriving: the lexicon entries a repo's cli implements and its lexicon does not declare.

Part of `lib.lexicon`. For code written before its lexicon entries: it reads what the cli
offers, through the same CLI audit every other lexicon reader uses (`_audit`), and names
each noun, verb and param missing from the lexicon as the `lexicon create` command that
would declare it. By default that list is the whole output; with `apply` each command is
run through `declare`, get-or-create, so a second run finds nothing left to derive.

It reads the code and writes only the lexicon. It never grades the code, never edits it,
and never deletes an entry the code lacks: a declared verb with no code behind it is the
cli face's finding (`racecar.surface check`), and removing a declaration is a decision.

What it cannot derive, it does not write: every new entry's summary is a TODO and its
bearing `draft`, so a derived word reads as named-but-undefined until a person writes what
it means. A param is a flag the verb accepts (its long spelling without the dashes) or a
positional (its name), never the `--json` every verb carries or `-h`. It is listed on the
verb; a shared `param/` node is `check --apply`'s to write, once a second verb lists it.

Complexity: O(N + V + P) over the audited nodes, verbs and params, plus one CLI audit
