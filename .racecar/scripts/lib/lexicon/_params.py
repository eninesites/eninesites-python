"""The param checks: what a param's node says about how each verb takes it.

Part of `lib.lexicon`. A param node may carry `required`, `defined` and `position`, each
defaulted where absent (`PARAM_DEFAULTS`). `param-use` grades the first and last against what
argparse builds; `defined` reports every node a `create` wrote and no person has set.

Complexity: O(P) per tuple in its params, each a lookup in the per-verb arguments read once
