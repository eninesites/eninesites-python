"""The ontology: what kinds of thing a corpus contains, and what each must carry.

`scripts/ontology.py` is one command line over this and `racecar.graph.ontology` is another,
so a caller imports what it needs instead of loading a script by path to reach a function.

Delivered WHOLE into an adopter's `.racecar/scripts/lib/ontology/`, the same way
`lib.lexicon` is: a package survives delivery exactly as a single file does.

One verb, one module, each with a `main` that `scripts/ontology.py` dispatches to:

  `_identify`  infer a candidate ontology from a corpus, read-only
  `_derive`    infer it, and write it to `--meta`
  `_check`     score a corpus against the ontology declared at `--meta`

and beneath them `_kinds`: reading a declared ontology, sampling a corpus, scoring the one
against the other, and inferring a proposal. `lib.graph` imports it from there.

Public names are re-exported here so `from lib.ontology import load_ontology` works.

Complexity: O(1) -- re-exports only
