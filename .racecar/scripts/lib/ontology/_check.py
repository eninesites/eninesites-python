"""The `check` verb: score a corpus against the ontology declared at `--meta`.

Part of `lib.ontology`; `scripts/ontology.py` parses the command line and calls `main`. The
scoring is `_kinds.check`; this returns the declared ontology beside the corpus's fit to it,
so one record carries both what was graded against and how it came out.

Exit: 0 the declared ontology fits, 1 it does not, 2 the check cannot run (a cyclic
`depends_on`, or `--domain` against a corpus that declares no `partition:`).

Complexity: O(S) in sources sampled, as `_kinds` states it
