"""The `derive` verb: infer a candidate ontology from a corpus, and write it.

Part of `lib.ontology`; `scripts/ontology.py` parses the command line and calls `main`. The
same inference `identify` runs (`_kinds.derive`), written to `--meta` as the
`ontology.yaml` shape `_kinds.load_ontology` itself reads. Two named verbs rather than one
verb and a mode flag, so the read/write split is in the verb's name.

Exit: 0 always -- a proposal is a report, and an empty one says so.

Complexity: O(S) in sources sampled, as `_kinds` states it
