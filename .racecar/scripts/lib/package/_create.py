"""The `create` verb on the delivered route: it cannot run here, and says where it can.

`create` scaffolds the `src/<pkg>` library from racecar's `templates/classic/`, renders the
server shell and its REST and MCP surfaces with racecar's server generator
(`racecar.lib._server`, which `racecar.surface` shares), and writes the Authorization Server
from `arch-python/templates/authserver/`. None of that is delivered, so an adopter's
`scripts/package.py` cannot build any of it. `scripts/surface.py` answers `rest` and `mcp`
the same way, for the same reason.

`python -m racecar.package create` does not reach this module: it runs
`racecar.package.api.create`, whose rungs are racecar's own code. The flags are
declared once, in `scripts/package.py`'s parser, so the two routes offer the same command.

Exit: 2, always.

Complexity: O(1)
