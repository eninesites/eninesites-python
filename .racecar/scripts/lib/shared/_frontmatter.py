"""The `---`-fenced block at the top of a markdown file, and what it declares.

A block opens on the file's first line and closes on the next line that is `---` alone.
Trailing spaces after either fence and CRLF line ends are tolerated, and a file may end
right at the closing fence. Everything after the closing fence is the body.

The readings, because callers want different things:

  `split(text)`       (block, body), or (None, text) when there is no block
  `block(text)`       the block's text, or None
  `load(source)`      the block as a mapping, or {} when absent or not a mapping
  `mapping(head)`     the block's text as a mapping; else raises `Invalid`, saying why
  `value(text, key)`  one key's value, read from that key's own lines, or None

`load` swallows a YAML error rather than raising. Real corpora hold files whose `---`
header is email headers rather than YAML, and one such file must not stop a walk over the
rest. A caller that has to report a bad block calls `mapping` and reports what it
raises. `value` parses one key and never the whole block, so a sibling key that is not
strict YAML (an unquoted colon in a `description:`) cannot erase the key asked for.

The standard library is enough for `split` and `block`; `load` imports PyYAML when it is
called, so a stdlib-only script (`bump_version.py`, which runs with no venv) can import
this module.

Complexity: O(n) in the file's length
