"""The one reader of a markdown file: which lines are frontmatter, which are code, which are text.

Every racecar reader of a markdown file goes through `parse` (or `read`) and asks the document
what it wants: its text lines, headings, title, sections or links. None splits a file itself.
When each reader skipped the frontmatter and the fences its own way, most did not, and a YAML
comment such as `# a note` above a README's real `# Title` was read as the title.

A line is in one region:

  `frontmatter`  the `---` block at the top, as `_frontmatter.split` bounds it
  `code`         a fenced block, from its opening marker through its closing one
  `text`         everything else

A fence opens on a line starting with three or more backticks or tildes, after any
indentation. It closes on a line whose marker is the same character and at least as long, as
CommonMark says: `~~~` does not close a backtick fence, and three backticks do not close four.
A block that never closes makes everything below it code; the document carries the open
marker (`unclosed`) so a reader that must not silently lose the rest of a file can say so.

Headings, the title, sections and links are read from text lines only. A reader that must see
every line -- a leak scan, where a leak in the frontmatter is still a leak -- reads `lines`
itself, and the choice is visible where it reads.

Line numbers count from 1 and are the file's own, frontmatter included, so a finding names the
line an editor opens.

Complexity: O(n) in lines
