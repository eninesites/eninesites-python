"""A checker's findings, collected in order and printed as `<prog>: <severity>: <message>`.

Three severities. An error gates: `emit` returns 1 when one was recorded. A warning and an
info note are printed and gate nothing. The difference between those two is what `OK`
means: a run with a warning is not OK, and says how many there were, while an info note
is context the reader may skip.

Named `_report` and not `_findings`: `lib/packaging/_findings.py` already holds a
different record, a single located `Finding`, and one word for two shapes is the
collision worth avoiding.

Complexity: O(n) in findings
