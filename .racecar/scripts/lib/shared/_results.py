"""Test results as records: read JUnit XML files, and say what they add up to.

A test runner's text is for a person; its exit code is one bit, and a pipe throws even
that away (`make test | tail` reports `tail`'s status). JUnit XML is the one machine
format every common runner can write: pytest `--junitxml`, `swift test --xunit-output`,
`go test` through `go-junit-report`. Each file holds one `<testcase>` per test, with a
`<failure>`, `<error>` or `<skipped>` child when it did not pass.

So the records are read from there, and the verdict is said in words, LAST: whatever
truncates the output from the top (`tail -1`) still shows it.

The files are ones a test run on this machine just wrote, so the standard library's
`xml.etree` is enough; it is not hardened against hostile XML, and nothing here reads XML
from anywhere else.

Complexity: O(t) in test cases across the files read.
