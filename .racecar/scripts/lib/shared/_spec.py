"""Where a package keeps its surface spec, and the spec's rows.

The spec is `surface.jsonl` at the repo root: one JSON object per line, one line per
command, and the one statement of what each command is and where it is served. The checker
that grades it, the cli face that writes rows into it, the server generator that reads it,
and the checks that run each command all need the same two answers, so they take them here.

A line that is not JSON is refused by name rather than skipped. A reader that skips it
answers for a spec with a command missing, which is the one thing every reader of this
file is there to catch.

Complexity: O(n) in lines
