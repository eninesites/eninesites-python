"""Mirror a template tree into an output tree, substituting placeholders.

Each template directory under arch-python/templates/<name>/ mirrors the target output
tree exactly: render_tree writes every file to out/<same relative path>, applying `subs`
(placeholder -> replacement) to its text. Empty files (package __init__.py) copy as empty;
*.sh files are made executable. A generator copies its static tree with render_tree, then
overlays the manifest-interpolated files (settings base, urlconf includes, per-vertical
adapters) on top -- so the template directory is a literal picture of what gets generated.

    Constraints: substitution is a global str.replace, over each file's text and over its

    (the __NAME__ / {name} convention) that cannot occur in real content, and a key that

    directories are not created (every package dir carries an __init__.py).
