"""Whether a package's copy of the error schema is there and current: the stale-copy check.

A package's `lib/error/_schema.py` is a copy of `scripts/error.json`, made by `surface
upgrade`. Sync replaces racecar's files in `.racecar/` but cannot write the package, so after
a sync the two can disagree. Both sync paths ask this module, so the answer and its wording
have one home. Only sync asks: it is the moment the repo chose to take racecar's changes. No
check reports it, because a repo is not required to keep up with racecar.

The package is read, never imported: `_schema.py` is parsed and its `SCHEMA` literal
evaluated, so a package that does not import still gets an answer. The reference is the
`error.json` beside this module's own `scripts/` tree: the racecar checkout the sync runs
from (a local clone, or the temporary one `sync_remote.py` makes).

Not copied into a package: the program never asks this question.
