"""The error packet's types, and `packet()`, which builds one that is valid.

Every face of a racecar program reports a failure as one `ErrorPacket`: the CLI
on stderr under `--json`, REST inside RFC 9457 problem details, MCP as an
error result. The shape and the per-code facts are declared once, in
`scripts/error.json`; `_schema.py` is that file as data, and this module reads
it rather than restating it.

Standard library only, and copied byte for byte into each package's
`lib/error/`, so a program reports errors the same way wherever it is
installed. Do not edit the copy: `upgrade` replaces it.
