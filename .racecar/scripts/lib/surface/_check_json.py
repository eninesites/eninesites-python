"""check-json: what each command's `--json` actually returns, found by running it.

`check` reads code and never runs it; this runs it. Every command in the repo's
`surface.jsonl` is listed, and each one the spec marks `read` (a verb that changes nothing,
`arch-python/SURFACES.md`) is run once, with `--json`, from the repo root. `read` says
nothing about arguments: a verb that requires one answers a bare run with its help on stderr,
`<prog>: needs <arguments>` as the last line, and exit 2 (`arch-python/CLI.md` B2). That is
not the verb's output, so it gets no verdict, and the record says what the verb needs. A write or
job verb is never run. A repo with no
`surface.jsonl` has no such declaration, so its commands, read from the command tree its code
builds, are listed and none is run.

One record per command, `{noun, verb, json, exit, needs}`:

- `noun`, `verb`: the command, as the lexicon names it; the package root's verbs are under
  the package name.
- `json`: true when stdout parses as JSON, whatever the document (`[]` and `{}` included);
  false when it printed something that does not parse; null when it printed nothing, or
  answered with B2's help for a missing argument.
- `exit`: the exit code; null when the command was not run, or did not finish in time.
- `needs`: the arguments B2 said the verb requires, read off its own `needs` line; `[]` when
  it answered without one, or was not run.

Each command runs under the repo's own interpreter where it has one, since its code imports
what that interpreter has.
