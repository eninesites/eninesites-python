"""check, update, upgrade and list: the cli against what the lexicon declares.

One planner walks the package and every noun the lexicon declares with at least one verb,
and yields one `Item` per way the code differs from the canonical form or from the
declaration. Each item carries the finding (`check` prints it), the change that answers it
(`update` prints it), and, when that change is mechanical, the function that makes it
(`upgrade` calls it). A change with no function is JUDGMENT: moving code somebody wrote, or
deciding between the lexicon and the code. `upgrade` leaves those for a person or the
`/racecar-surface` skill, and `update` keeps listing them until they are done.

What `upgrade` does by itself is narrow on purpose, because the thing it must never do is
break code that runs:

- write a missing package file (`errors.py`, `schema.py`, `lib/cli.py`,
  `lib/renderer/json.py`, the three `lib/error/` modules, the root `__main__.py`) only when
  nothing else in the package already defines what that file would, since a second
  `ApiError` beside the first is a second home, not a fix. The `lib/error/` modules are
  copied from `scripts/lib/shared/error/`, not rendered from the template;
- write a noun's missing package markers and renderer, and its `lib/results.py` only when
  no module of the noun declares a TypedDict already;
- build a declared noun that has no code at all, and add a declared verb to a noun that
  conforms, both through `create`;
- add a built noun's row to its parent's `commands()` when that is a literal.

Everything is read from the code's structure, never from a mark left in it. `upgrade`
re-plans after each pass and stops when a pass changes nothing; a mechanical change that
survives its own application is reported rather than retried, so the loop cannot spin.
