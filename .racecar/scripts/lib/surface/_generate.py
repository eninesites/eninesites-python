"""`generate --surface cli --docs`: the README's `## CLI` block, and which verbs lack `output()`.

Both are renderings of the CLI code, not of the lexicon, which is why they live with the noun
that builds faces. The lexicon declares, lists and checks entries and writes nothing else, and
every lexicon page is written by a person.

The block is the CLI audit's own rendering (`check_cli_commands.render_tree`), so the README
shows byte for byte what `make arch` audits and there is no second renderer to drift. The
audit runs in a child process with the repo's `src` on its path: a repo is graded without
importing it into this interpreter, and a second repo's `acme` is never the first one's.

The presweep answers two questions the block's run can answer on the way: which declared verbs
render no schema because their leaf declares no `output()`, and which leaves could not be
loaded to ask. The two are kept apart, because a leaf that raised on load declares schemas
nobody could read, and saying `no output()` about it would send the reader to write them.
