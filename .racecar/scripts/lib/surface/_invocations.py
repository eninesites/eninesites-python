"""The command lines that exercise a noun's cli: the parser half derived, the run half declared.

A comparison of a command's output before and after an edit is only as good as the list of
commands it runs. It has two halves, and they come from different places on purpose.

**The parser half is derived, every time, never stored.** Per node: the bare node, `-h`, an
unknown verb and an unknown flag; per verb: `<verb> -h`, and the bare verb where it needs an
argument, which argparse answers without running anything. None of these runs a verb, so none
has a side effect, and all of them come from `parser()` alone -- the CLI audit's tree. Read
from the code being compared, a removed flag or verb then shows up as a difference.

**The run half is declared, in the lexicon**, beside the verb's `params:`, as `invocations:`:
one entry per command line, the arguments after the verb and, optionally, the directory inside
the tree it runs from. It is authored apart from the code it grades, which is what P-07 asks of
anything a check compares against. Every declared line of a built verb runs, whatever its
kind: `_transcript` runs each one in its own copy of the tree, with a scratch home and no
credentials, so what a `write` line writes lands in the copy and nothing it does can reach a
tracker, a bucket or a host that needs a key.

A built `read` or `write` verb with no declared entry is a finding, so the list cannot fall
behind the cli without `check` saying so, and `update` proposes the entries it lacks from its
parser: one per switch, one per choice value, a `<value>` where a value is needed. The author
edits that skeleton and deletes the lines that are only rendering choices (arch-python/CLI.md:
a flag that only re-groups or reformats owes no second scenario). A `job` verb owes none: it
starts work that keeps running after it returns, so a line that replays it has to be chosen,
never demanded. `surface create` seeds `invocations: [""]` on a `read` or `write` verb it
records, so a package built from a list of `create` calls carries a line for each.
