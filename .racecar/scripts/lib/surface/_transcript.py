"""What each command prints before an edit and after it, compared line for line.

`api-fix/SKILL.md` makes this the condition for applying any edit to a surface.
It runs the command lines `_invocations` lists on both trees and reports every one whose
transcript -- stdout, stderr and exit code -- differs.

**Before is a git ref**, default `HEAD`, checked out in a scratch worktree and run with that
worktree's `src/` first on the import path. A worktree sharing the parent's virtualenv would
otherwise import the parent's package, and "before" would be the after code. **After is the
working tree.** Both run under the repo's own interpreter.

**Only the nodes an edit can reach are compared**: those whose static import closure, within
the package, holds a file that differs between the ref and the working tree, and those whose
lexicon pages changed. A change to `lib/cli.py` therefore compares every node. A node whose
closure imports `racecar.lib._dispatch` also runs checker scripts it names only at run time,
which no import reaches, so any change under a script directory reaches it too: an edit to
`scripts/check_docs.py` compares `arch check`, the command that loads it.

**The list is the old code's parser half and the lexicon's declared half.** Generated from the
old code and run on the new, a flag or verb the edit removed shows up as a difference; a
declared line runs only where its spec row lets it (`_invocations`).

**Each line runs isolated, in its own copy of the tree**: every file git sees, copied into a
fresh repo, so what a `write` line writes lands in the copy and never in the tree being
compared, and no line sees what another wrote. `HOME` and `TMPDIR` point at a scratch
directory, bytecode is not written, and every variable that names a credential -- a token, a
key, a password, an agent socket -- is left out of the environment, so no line can reach a
tracker, a bucket or a host that needs one. A declared fixture is the directory inside the copy
the line runs from.

**Output is normalised** before it is compared -- the tree roots, the scratch paths, dates,
times, durations and hex ids -- because two honest runs differ in each of those. **What the
patterns miss is measured rather than guessed**: a line whose transcripts differ runs again on
both trees, and every transcript line that changed between two runs of the same code is left
out of the comparison. What is left differs because the code does. The count of lines left out
is reported with each noun, so an ignored line is never a silent pass.
