"""Every surface verb's text view, rendered from the record the verb returns.

The one home of what a person reads. `scripts/surface.py` and `python -m racecar.surface`
both reach a verb's `main`, which gathers the record and hands it here, so the two routes
print the same lines because only this module makes them. `--json` prints the record itself.
Each function returns the lines for one stream; the verb's `main` says which stream.

Complexity: O(R) in the record's rows
