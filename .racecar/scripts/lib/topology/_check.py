"""The `check` verb: gate a corpus's tier shape against the topology it declares.

Part of `lib.topology`; `scripts/topology.py` parses the command line and calls `main`. The
declaration, the walk and the grade are `_walk`'s, whose `check` returns the graph and its
errors; this verb resolves the default declaration, and `renderer.text` is how the record
reads. A tier shape either holds or does not, so this one answers 0 clean / 1 any error.

Exit: 0 the tier shape holds, 1 any error.

Complexity: O(N), N = nodes walked, as `_walk` states it
