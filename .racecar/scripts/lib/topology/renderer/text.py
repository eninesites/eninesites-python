"""Every topology verb's text view, rendered from the record the verb returns.

The one home of what a person reads. `scripts/topology.py` and
`python -m racecar.graph.topology` both call a verb for its record and hand the record here,
so the two routes print the same lines because only this module prints them. `--json` prints
the record itself; every line here is read off that record.

Complexity: O(n) in the record's nodes
