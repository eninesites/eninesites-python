"""Print what one or more JUnit XML files add up to, the verdict on the last line.

`racecar.mk`'s test recipe runs this over the file pytest just wrote, so the summary a
person or a pipe sees is read from records, not grepped out of pytest's text. The exit
code is always 0: the run's own status is the test's, and this only reports it.

Usage:
    python3 <path-to>/results.py <junit.xml> [<junit.xml> ...]

Complexity: O(t) in test cases across the files given.
