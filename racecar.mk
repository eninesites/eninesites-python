# racecar.mk — canonical racecar build. Synced by racecar; DO NOT EDIT.
#
# This file is IDENTICAL in every racecar project — it carries no per-repo content.
# It detects the project shape from what is on disk (PACKAGING.md "Scope") and
# selects the matching source variables, falling back to stock for any layout it
# does not recognize. Project-specific targets and variable overrides belong in the
# owned `Makefile`, which `include`s this file; edits here are lost on `make racecar-sync`.
#
# Tools are invoked as `$(PYTHON) -m <tool>` / `$(BIN)/<tool>` (never bare names),
# so no target needs an *activated* venv — `make check` works from a cold shell,
# sidestepping the GNU Make 3.81 (macOS) PATH-export bug where `export PATH :=` is
# ignored for non-shell execvp lookups. Requires pip >= 25.1 for PEP 735.

# --- shape: governed by what is on disk. The same decision check_packaging.detect_shape
# makes, expressed in Make so racecar.mk stays self-contained (no script call to know the
# shape). Shape = PYTHON_LIBRARY x DJANGO_PROJECT (manage.py). The library is src/<pkg>, or,
# with no src/, the package [project].name names at the repo root (flat_package in
# lib/shared/_root.py; `-` and `.` read as `_`): src / flat (library only), src+server /
# flat+server (library x server/manage.py), server (standalone server/manage.py, no
# library), django (a root manage.py site — the django-admin startproject canon, no
# library). Django is marked by a manage.py, never a bare server/; a root manage.py beside a
# library is not the django shape (a library's Django belongs under server/), so it degrades
# to the library reading. TODO: the {packages,pypkg}/<pkg>/src/<pkg> library-axis workspace
# form is a downstream addition. ---

#
# It is a variable so a repo that keeps its checkers somewhere else can say so. racecar
# itself no longer needs that: its scripts live in one flat `scripts/`, the same shape
# delivery produces, so the default is correct in the canon repo too. It was not always --
# racecar used to hold them under eight lens directories and override this, which is why
# the variable exists at all.
#
# Space-separated search path; the first directory containing the script wins.
#
# A name that resolves nowhere is an `$(error)`. `$(wildcard)` yields EMPTY on a miss, so
# without it `$(PYTHON) $(call racecar_script,x.py)` degrades to a bare `python3`, which
# reads EOF and exits 0 -- a gate reporting green having run nothing (R-10).
#
# CONSEQUENCE FOR ANYONE ADDING A CALL SITE. `$(error)` fires at EXPANSION time, and Make
# expands a target's whole recipe before running its first line. A shell `if` around the
# call therefore cannot skip it, and the failure takes the entire target, not one line. So
# a script that is only SOMETIMES delivered needs a MAKE-level guard. There is one today:
# `sync_scripts.DJANGO_SCRIPTS` ships check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py only to a repo with a
# manage.py, and its call site sits behind `ifneq ($(_DJANGO_MNG),)` in `_arch`, which keeps
# the untaken branch out of the recipe so the `$(call)` never expands. Anything added to a
# conditional manifest needs the same.
# Where `make` and the pre-commit hooks find racecar's checkers: the directory sync
# delivers them into. The same value in racecar and in every adopter, because racecar
# runs this file AS AN ADOPTER -- it commits its own `.racecar/scripts/` like anyone else.
# racecar's own CLI (`python -m racecar.*`) is the other caller and reaches `scripts/`
# directly, because that is racecar's source rather than a copy of it.
#
# TWO entries, and the order is the whole point. `.racecar/scripts` is where delivery puts
# them now; `rc_scripts` is where it put them before `.racecar/` became one boundary for
# everything racecar owns in a repo. An adopter is on the old layout until the sync that
# moves them, and that sync runs `make` -- so a single-entry default would break the gate
# of every repo in exactly the window the upgrade needs it working. The retired name is

# check-architecture, check-skill-reachability and check-script-ownership (self-hosting
# racecar's own gates beyond what it delivers); listing `fmt-check lint test` here by name
# instead of depending on `_check` meant `check-full` silently never ran any of the four,
# despite its own description claiming to be the full gate.
# The legs run in PARALLEL and render in a FIXED order, which `make -j` alone cannot do:
# `--output-sync=target` is a make 4.0 option and macOS ships 3.81, where passing it is a
# hard error rather than a no-op. `gate_orchestrate.py` is that flag as a stdlib script --
# it spawns the legs at once and prints each one whole, in the order named here, as soon as
# every leg before it has finished. See its module docstring.
#
# `_check` and the test legs are disjoint: one grades the code and
# runs the fast tier, the other grades the suites and runs the slow tier. Nothing is done
# twice, so the two are a partition rather than an overlap -- which is what makes running
# them concurrently safe rather than merely faster.
#
# Still depends on `_check` transitively through that sub-make, so `check-full` remains a

# would pass. Kept apart, each half is redirected and each status is read on its own line.

#
# At the ADOPTER ROOT, not under $(RACECAR_SCRIPT_DIRS): isort's first-party-import
# detection is sensitive to the settings file's own filesystem location, and a copy
# nested a directory below the tree it grades misclassifies a sibling module as
# third-party (issue #47). Root-relative and independent of RACECAR_SCRIPT_DIRS --
# canon's rulebook is not itself one of the check scripts it governs.

# The same delivered set as a regex, because pylint and mypy take a scope as DIRECTORIES and
# subtract by pattern where the formatters take a file list. Lazily assigned: it costs a
# python start, and `make help` must not pay for it. Empty means nothing was delivered, and
# every use below is guarded on that -- an empty --ignore-paths would match everything.
#
# MEMOIZED past that first cost, and that second part is not optional. `lint`'s own ignore-path
# composition below references this more than once by construction -- an emptiness test plus
# the value itself, repeated at every layer of the `$(if)`/`$(and)` chain it feeds -- and a
# lazily-assigned (`=`) variable RE-RUNS its `$(shell)` on every single reference; Make caches
# nothing between them. Measured in this repo: 12 spawns of check_content_blind.py per
# `make lint` for what should be one. `:=` would fix the count but pays the python start on
# EVERY make invocation, including `make help` -- exactly the cost the paragraph above already
# refuses. So this caches its own result the first time anything asks for it within one `make`
# run, and stays lazy otherwise: nothing runs until that first reference, whichever target it
# turns out to be. The DONE sentinel is separate from the cached value because the value is
# routinely empty (nothing delivered, the common case) and `$(if EMPTY,...)` cannot tell
# "not yet computed" from "computed and empty" on its own. The `$(subst $$,$$$$,...)` around
# the `$(shell)` call matters and is not decorative: `$(eval)` expands its argument once to
# build the `VAR := ...` line and then parses THAT as a second, independent piece of makefile
# text, so a raw `$` surviving from the shell's own output (this is a regex; `$` anchors are
# routine) gets treated as the start of a variable reference on that second pass and silently
# vanishes. Doubling it first means the second pass collapses `$$` back to the one `$` the
# shell actually printed, instead of eating it.

# A racecar-delivered file is subtracted here, at the point the list is built, and not in
# either formatter's config. black honours `exclude` / `extend-exclude` only while WALKING a
# directory: a path named explicitly on the command line -- which is exactly what this list
# becomes -- bypasses both, and only `force-exclude` survives it. So the two forms disagree
# on one tree and one config, and `fmt` WRITES, which made this a silent rewrite of files the
# repo does not own rather than a red check.
#
# isort has the SAME asymmetry and was wrongly recorded here as not having it. Its `skip` /
# `skip_glob` are honoured while walking and defeated by an explicit path unless
# `--filter-files` is passed -- measured: walk 0, explicit 1, explicit with the flag 0. So
# both recipes pass it, and a repo whose config skips `*/migrations/*` gets that skip back.
#
# The membership question is answered by `check_content_blind.py --exclude-delivered`, which
# owns the delivery record's format, rather than by a second parser here. Which files racecar
# delivered is RACECAR's fact and its record already ships; `force-exclude` would move the
# rule into the adopter's own pyproject.toml, where every repo must declare it and can forget.
#
# In racecar itself this subtracts NOTHING, and that is the point: racecar AUTHORS the files
# it delivers, so it must keep formatting them. Only a repo that received them by sync has
# something to exclude, and only there would `make fmt` and `racecar sync` otherwise fight
# with no fixed point.

# The formatters are fed the .gitignore boundary AS A LIST, because "which files are ours"
# already has an answer and it is `.gitignore`. `PYFILES` asks git for it: tracked files plus
# new ones that are not ignored. One home for the boundary, and no second list that can drift
# from it.
#
# The list is what makes this fast, and the reason is not obvious. Pointing the formatters at
# `.` and letting them filter is correct and costs 6.7s here, because `--gitignore` and
# black's native handling both apply AFTER the walk -- they fix the scope and never touched
# the cost. The same files named up front: 0.44s. `--others --exclude-standard` is not
# optional in that command: without it a brand-new file is invisible to `fmt-check` and gets
# reformatted by the commit hook, which is precisely the failure described below.
#
# This replaced FMT_PATHS := $(SRC) $(SERVER) $(wildcard tests). That list was NARROWER than
# the pre-commit hooks, which carry `types: [python]` and format every changed file. So the
# old arrangement had a live failure: edit a root-level conftest.py or tools/ script, `make
# fix` skips it, `fmt-check` passes, and then the commit hook reformats it. The comment that
# used to sit here described exactly that failure and fixed it only for `tests` by bolting
# one more path on. `.` fixes the general case, which is what "formatting scope must match
# the hooks', or the gate is not the gate" actually requires.
#
# To keep a subtree out: `.gitignore` it. That is the whole boundary. Third-party code
# committed into the tree and not gitignored is the owner's problem to declare, not racecar's
# to guess around.
# THE LIST IS BUILT ONCE, INTO A FILE, AND EACH TOOL IS GRADED ON ITS OWN STATUS. Both halves
# of that are defects this replaced, and each was silent.
#
# The file list was a PIPELINE piped into `xargs`, and a pipeline reports only its last stage.
# A failure upstream -- the filter's script missing, a delivery record it cannot read, git
# itself failing -- read as xargs succeeding on an empty list, so both targets reported success

# What a CLI ENTRY POINT legitimately does that the modules below it must not. Argued in

# why pylint cannot express the exception itself:
#   import-outside-toplevel  a `__main__.py` defers a verb module's import into its

#                            FILES a pass grades -- exactly how the test profile below is
#                            scoped, and for the same reason.
# Relaxing it here does NOT leave the deferral ungraded. `check_deferred_imports.py` (run
# by `make arch`) grades its SHAPE, and that check is narrower than the message it
# replaces: dispatch only, never a pure data function, never a nested scope, never upward.

# LINT_PATHS: what pylint grades. Defaults to everything committed; a repo whose lintable code
# is wider still sets it with `LINT_PATHS = ...` before the include rather than redefining this
# recipe -- an override makes Make warn on every invocation and forks canon in owned space.
LINT_PATHS ?= $(SRC) $(wildcard scripts)

# LINT_TEST_IGNORE: what makes the two pylint passes DISJOINT BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by
# where a repo happens to keep its suites.
#
# The two scopes never overlapped only because of a layout coincidence. With a root `tests/`,
# $(LINT_PATHS) and $(TEST_PATHS) are separate trees and the test profile is the only pass
# that sees a suite. With suites INSIDE the package -- `src/<pkg>/*/tests/` -- $(SRC) already
# contains them, so the strict pass graded every test file with no plugin and no relaxation,
# and setting TEST_PATHS only ADDED a second, redundant pass over files the first had already
# reported. The comment above TEST_PATHS described a remedy that did not apply.
#
# Narrowing LINT_PATHS is not the remedy either. `ignore-paths` in the rcfile applies to every
# invocation, so it would blind the test-profile pass as well and leave the suites graded by
# nothing -- the state RACECAR_TEST_LINT ?= true exists to prevent. pylint takes the option
# per invocation, so the exclusion is scoped to the passes that must not see a suite. The
# rcfile stays untouched as a FILE -- but its VALUE for this option does not survive a flag,
# which is what LINT_IGNORE_PATHS below composes back in.
#
# The regex is anchored at a path boundary on both ends, which is what makes it work for the
# two ways pylint is handed work: a DIRECTORY (`src`) that it walks, and an explicit FILE LIST
# (what a `find`-built LINT_PATHS produces). `tests` must not match `tests_helper.py` and must
# match `src/pkg/sub/tests/test_it.py`.
#
# Unconditional, including when RACECAR_TEST_LINT=false. That is the point of the rule rather
# than an oversight: a directory named by TEST_PATHS is graded under the test profile or not
# at all, so switching the test profile off now removes the suites from linting in BOTH
# layouts. Before this it took a root `tests/` out entirely and took nothing out for a repo
# whose suites were inside the package.
# Holds the bare comma-joined regex, never the flag and never the quoting. `print-%` is
# `echo '$(VAR)'`, so a value carrying its own single quotes would break the one way a hook
# or a test can read a resolved variable. The recipes below add `--ignore-paths=` and the
# quotes, which is where the shell metacharacters need protecting anyway.

# LINT_IGNORE_PATHS: the WHOLE value of `--ignore-paths` for the passes that override it,
# which is the rcfile's own list UNION the test patterns above.
#
# pylint gives an option ONE value. A list passed on the command line REPLACES whatever the
# rcfile set for that option -- it does not union with it. So passing $(LINT_TEST_IGNORE)
# alone took every pattern the repo declared in its own rcfile out of the strict pass the
# moment TEST_PATHS became non-empty. The rcfile was untouched as a FILE; its value was not.
#
# The loss was silent in the direction that matters: nothing reports a dropped exclusion, so
# the gate simply starts grading trees the repo scoped out and the findings read as ordinary
# new drift rather than as a lost setting. One repo met this as 84 findings across a vendored
# tree and two deferred subsystems, none of which it lints on purpose.
#
# The two lists are not the same kind of thing, which is why both must hold at once and
# neither can be expressed through the other. The rcfile's patterns say THIS TREE IS NOT OURS
# TO GRADE (vendored code, generated output, a deferred subsystem). The test patterns say
# THIS TREE IS GRADED UNDER THE OTHER PROFILE. Expressing both through one option that only
# one of them can own is what forced the loss.
#
# The rcfile stays the one home for the repo's own exclusions -- `check_docs.py`,
# `check_doc_graph.py` and `check_file_placement.py` read that same key, so a repo declaring
# a tree out of scope declares it once. This reads it back through the same reader rather
# than growing a second parser in Make: `check_docs.py --print-ignore-paths` prints what
# those checkers match with, under BOTH spellings of pylint's first section (`MAIN` and the
# legacy `MASTER`), since pylint honors either and a repo that used the other spelling would
# otherwise lose its whole list here.
#
# Comma-joined, which is pylint's list syntax on the command line AND in the rcfile: it
# splits every value of this option on commas, so a pattern carrying one is already not
# expressible upstream and joining loses nothing that pylint could have read.
#
# The sentinel is the point of the rule rather than belt-and-braces. A reader that fails
# prints nothing, and empty output is indistinguishable from "this repo declares no
# exclusions" -- which would silently reinstate the exact defect this composition fixes. So
# an unreadable list becomes a word pylint never sees, and `lint` stops on it below.

# The fast tier. It RE-ENTERS `test` with two variables rather than carrying its own pytest
# recipe, and that indirection is the whole point: an adopter who overrides `test:` in their

# this target. A second recipe here would silently route around their override and run stock
# pytest instead -- the gate quietly stops grading what they told it to grade, with no

# TYPECHECK_PATHS: what mypy grades. Everything the repo commits, same rule as LINT_PATHS,
# and tests are IN unconditionally -- RACECAR_TEST_LINT governs pylint only, because the
# relaxations it names are about style in test code, not about its types. Scoping mypy
# narrower than the code you ship is how a typing gate becomes decorative.
#
# There is deliberately no TEST_TYPECHECK_RELAX to mirror TEST_LINT_RELAX, and the asymmetry
# is mypy's, not an omission. The rule this gets asked about is `no_implicit_reexport`: a test
# doing `from <pkg> import _helper`, where `_helper` is defined in `<pkg>._impl` and merely
# imported by `<pkg>/__init__.py`, fails with `Module "<pkg>" does not explicitly export
# attribute "_helper"`. It looks like the private-symbol access `protected-access` is already
# relaxed for in TEST_LINT_RELAX, so a matching mypy profile looks like the answer. It is not
# available: mypy applies `no_implicit_reexport` per EXPORTING module, so the only override
# that silences it names the library, not the tests -- which would drop the check for every
# caller, not just the suite.
#
# Fix it at the source, and there are three routes of which only one is free. Declare
# `__all__` in the package: it states the public surface outright, satisfies mypy, and is the
# ONLY route both gates accept unchanged. `from ._impl import _helper as _helper` also
# satisfies mypy -- the repeated name is PEP 484's explicit re-export marker -- but pylint
# reports `useless-import-alias` on it and the base scaffold ships no disable, because
# [tool.pylint] starts at `disable = []` on purpose; a repo taking that route writes the one
# entry WITH its own argument, the bar every other entry in that list clears. Importing from
# the module that DEFINES the symbol clears both gates too, and gives up the package boundary
# the re-export existed to draw.
#
# These are DIRECTORIES, not a file list, which works because [tool.mypy] sets
# `exclude_gitignore = true`: mypy walks the tree and skips whatever git already ignores
# (.venv/, build/, dist/, vendored trees), so the scope needs no second exclusion list of
# its own. Adding a directory here is therefore additive and safe.

# EVERY CHECKER IN THIS LEG RUNS, AND THE TARGET FAILS ONCE AT THE END. The recipe used to
# be one `@`-line per checker, so make ended the target at the first non-zero exit and the
# ones behind it graded nothing: a repo carrying a single lexicon finding never reached
# `check_changelog`, `check_brief` or the generated-docs check, and the last of those
# reported 56 errors the first time it was run by hand. The cost is not that findings are
# missed forever -- it is that their number is unknowable until the ones in front of them are
# gone, so a repo cannot budget the work and a checker added to the end of this list can sit
# ungraded for as long as anything ahead of it is red.
#
# Everything around this already aggregates: each checker prints all of its own findings, and
# `gate_orchestrate.py` runs every LEG to completion and reports them side by side. Only
# *within* a leg did the first failure hide the rest, which is the one place a reader would
# not expect it.
#
# So each step records its status instead of ending the target, and the last step names which
# ones found something. The order is unchanged and deliberate, and the steps are NOT
# parallelized: some read what an earlier one writes. `gate_orchestrate.py` is not the home
# for this -- it spawns make TARGETS concurrently, and these are sequential commands.
#
# `docs_orchestrate.py` is the nearer relative: it already runs doc checkers as staged gates
# and returns one exit code over all of them. It is deliberately NOT what this target calls,
# and the reason is what the two sets contain rather than the mechanism. It runs
# `check_content_blind.py`, which is switched off here by owner direction (below), and it does
# not run `check_changelog.py` or `surface generate --docs`. Routing this
# target through it would silently re-enable one check and drop three, which is a decision
# about what the gate grades and not a fix to how it reports. Reconciling the two sets is the
# owner's call; until then the leg reports in full, which is all this recipe claims.
#
# One property this recipe now owes a reader: A STEP WHOSE SUCCESSOR DEPENDS ON IT HAVING
# SUCCEEDED MUST NOT BE IN THE ACCUMULATED SET. None is today -- no step here writes what a
# later one grades, `surface generate --docs` writing nothing without `--apply` -- and a step
# that gains such a dependent stays sequenced with a `|| exit 1` instead.
#
# The whole recipe is ONE shell command, joined with `; \`, which is what lets a status
# accumulate across steps. That is also why the comments sit above the target rather than
# between the steps: a `#` line inside a continued recipe ends the logical line, and the
# accumulator would silently split into two shells.
#
# Content blindness is COMMENTED OUT at the owner's direction (2026-09-19). It is the one
# doc checker switched off by hand rather than by config, so it is switched off where it is
# invoked -- here, and in the root Makefile's `check-content-blind` -- and nowhere else.
# Restore by adding this step back between `check_required_docs` and the lexicon check, and
# uncommenting the root Makefile's:
#
#     $(PYTHON) $(call racecar_script,check_content_blind.py) || fail="$$fail check_content_blind"; \
#
# The `--exclude-delivered` / `--only-delivered` / `--delivered-regex` uses of the same
# script are file SELECTION for lint and typecheck, not the check, and they stay.
#
# The two vocabulary gates hold this repo's words to racecar's TERM TREES, which are
# racecar's one home for them and not something an adopter keeps a copy of. With no
# racecar checkout on the machine there is no canon to check against, so they are skipped
# with a printed reason rather than run against nothing — a checker that reports OK
# because it found nothing to read is the failure these two exist to prevent. A repo
# carrying its own docs/lexicon/param/ has something to check either way, so it still runs.
#
# The last step is the generated projections, CHECKED rather than merely generatable. A
# projection with no gate goes stale silently, and this repo proved it: the CLI-docs
# generator's `--check` shipped and was wired into nothing for months, so a node quoting a
# finding the code had stopped emitting passed `make check-full` clean. `cli-docs/SKILL.md`
# had said to wire it into CI the whole time -- the instruction existed and nothing enforced
# it, which is the shape R-02 is about.
#
# What is generated now is one block, the README's `## CLI`, rendered by the CLI audit, and
# `racecar.surface generate --surface cli --docs --strict` fails when the tree left it STALE.
# The lexicon writes lexicon entries and no node body: every lexicon node is authored.
# The step runs the delivered `surface.py`, the same verb `racecar.surface` wraps, so it runs
# in every clone whether or not racecar is installed.
#
# Every step here reads only the clone: the repo's own files and what racecar delivered into
# `.racecar/`, never an installed racecar. A repo pushed by someone with racecar and cloned by
# someone without it must give the same answer. So the lexicon grades the corpus
# `.racecar/docs/lexicon` + `docs/lexicon` (a clean no-op when neither exists), and doc drift,
# which compares against racecar's templates, belongs to `racecar upgrade`, not here.
