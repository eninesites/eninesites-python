"""Any verb's api result as JSON on stdout: what every cli prints under ``--json``.

One renderer for every noun, because nothing about it is noun-specific. A result holds
JSON types only, so rendering it is ``json.dumps`` and nothing else: no key is added,
renamed or dropped, and the shape printed is the one ``output()`` publishes. Nothing else
reaches stdout under ``--json``; a diagnostic or a refusal goes to stderr, and a refusal goes
there as one JSON document too (``error``), so an agent reads why a verb could not run as
data rather than as a sentence.
